          <p>During my first week of “funemployment”, I decided to get a head start on developing my network by attending a handful of sessions at San Diego Startup Week that took place at the end of June. While there were many valuable takeaways from all of the sessions that I attended – which I will most likely reference in future posts – the one that really hit home was Rob Ryan’s “How to Build a Global Startup” session on June 26. I was attracted to this session since I have aspirations to create my own global startup focused on healthcare, so I figured that at the minimum, I should at least listen and learn from others that have endeavored on the same path.</p>
          <p>But I walked away with much more than that.</p>
          <p>Rob Ryan somehow broke down what appears to most of us a very complex, overwhelming scenario of establishing a global startup into steps that are much more manageable and easy to visualize. He didn’t necessarily give us a To Do list for creating a global startup, but rather, he shared with us his experiences of creating one of his own and sharing with us lessons learned on how he accomplished creating his global startup company, <a href="https://www.growthhax.com/">GrowthHax</a>. I won’t reiterate all of the key takeaways from his session, but in short, it’s as simple as putting yourself out there to network and actually work with like-minded, passionate individuals in other countries. And forming a global startup can be done by anyone, whether you’re a 24-year-old Harvard graduate aspiring to share their knowledge with the world or a 65-year-old blue collar retiree that wants to take a shot at changing the world.</p>
          <p>While I learned a lot of valuable lessons during Rob Ryan’s speech, it also inspired me to start bigger. And bolder. And globally. Well, at least within Latin America. My initial plan was to launch the product – whether it’s an app or a service – in one country outside of the United States, but then I thought to myself…why start with just one country? Why not more? All I need to do is start putting myself out there and talk with people that are just as passionate as I am about solving problems.</p>
          <p>I’m ready to start changing the world, one conversation at a time.</p>
